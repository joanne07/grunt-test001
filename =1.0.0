Running sanity checks on your system

✔ Global configuration file is valid
✔ NODE_PATH matches the npm root
✔ Node.js version
✖ No .bowerrc file in home directory

issues by overriding expected default config. Prefer setting up one `.bowerrc` per
project.

To delete the file, run: rm ~/.bowerrc

✔ No .yo-rc.json file in home directory
